# Dialog Operators in Requirements Engineering.

## Models

There are numerous models modelled as graphs indicating the dependencies between different modules in
requirements engineering. The i* framework[1] proposes an agent-oriented approach to requirements engineering centering on the intentional characteristics of the agent.  Agents attribute intentional properties (such as goals, beliefs, abilities, commitments) to each other and reason about strategic relationships.  Dependencies between agents give rise to opportunities as well as vulnerabilities.  Networks of dependencies are analyzed using a qualitative reasoning approach.  Agents consider alternative configurations of dependencies to assess their strategic positioning in a social context.
The framework is used in contexts in which there are multiple parties (or autonomous units) with strategic interests which may be reinforcing or conflicting in relation to each other.  Examples of such contexts include: business process redesign, business redesign, information systems requirements engineering, analyzing the social embedding of information technology, and the design of agent-based software systems.
The framework consists of nodes and edges with **Tasks** and **Resources** representing input nodes, while **Goals** and **SoftGoals** representing output nodes. Edges are used to propogate values from one node to another. Edges are of four types
* **Dependency** : Parent depends on child. ie If the child is satisfied, then the parent is also satisfied
* **Contribution** : Quantitates softgoals. This edge can be of 4 types: **Make**, **Help**, **Hurt** and **Break**.
* **Decomposition** : Represents logical AND edges.
* **Means-Ends** : Represents logical OR edges.
* 
The figure below highlights the model with an example

In the above figure "Restrict Structure of Password" and "Ask for Secret Question" are identified as unsatisfied and satisfied respectively. These values are propagated through the edges to compute the value of each node. The satisifability of each node is highlighted on it as the values are propogated.



Models are described in the following formats
* Smaller Models in **Py*** graph notation. [Here](https://github.com/dr-bigfatnoob/softgoals/tree/master/src/pystar/models)
* Larger Models in **Py*** graph notation. [Here](https://github.com/dr-bigfatnoob/softgoals/blob/master/src/pystar/models/dot_models.py)
* Larger models in json notation. [Here](https://github.com/dr-bigfatnoob/softgoals/tree/master/src/pystar/json)
* Larger models in graphviz notation. [Here](https://github.com/dr-bigfatnoob/softgoals/tree/master/src/pystar/graphviz)
* .itarml and .ood (No Parser exists)

### Model description using **Py***
 Py* is developed in python where each node/edge is represented as a python class. The class hierachy with each base class followed by their child classes is as follows
 
 ```
 Component
 |.. Node
 |.. |.. Task
 |.. |.. Resource
 |.. |.. Goal
 |.. |.. Softgoal
 |.. Edge
 |.. |.. Dependency
 |.. |.. Decomposition
 |.. |.. |.. AND
 |.. |.. |.. OR
 |.. |.. Contribution
 |.. |.. |.. Make
 |.. |.. |.. Help
 |.. |.. |.. Hurt
 |.. |.. |.. Break
```

The graph is evaluated as follows:
* A node is selected at random from the graph.
* The incoming edges of the node are identified and all the child nodes are recursively evaluated.
* Two kinds of conflicts can arise while evaluating the nodes
  * The incoming edges can be conflicting. For example, one incoming edge can be **help**, while the other can be **hurt**. In such cases a random value(satisfied or unsatisfied) is assigned to the node.
  * A loop can exist. i.e While propagating through the nodes, we notice that the same node is visited again. In such cases too, a random value is assigned to the node.

A sample model shown above is represented as follows

```python
from template import *

N = Many()
# Nodes
n1 = N + SoftGoal(name = "Provide accurate Information", container="Witnesses")
n2 = N + SoftGoal(name = "To know what to do", container="Witnesses")
n3 = N + Task(name = "Follow instructions from firemen", container="Witnesses")
n4 = N + Task(name = "Provide crisis related info", container="Witnesses")
n5 = N + Task(name = "Provide to fireman", container="Witnesses")
n6 = N + Task(name = "Provide info to police", container="Witnesses")
n7 = N + HardGoal(name = "Receive instructions", container="Witnesses")
n8 = N + Resource(name = "Crisis-related information", container="Fire")
n9 = N + Resource(name = "Instructions", container="Fire")
n10 = N + Resource(name = "Instructions", container="Police")
n11 = N + Task(name = "Crisis-related information", container="Police")

E = Many()
#Edges
e1 = E + SomePlus(source = n7,target = n2)
e2 = E + Or(source = n7,target = n3)
e3 = E + And(source = n5,target = n4)
e4 = E + And(source = n6,target = n4)
e5 = E + Dep(source = n5,target = n8)
e6 = E + Dep(source = n9,target = n7)
e7 = E + Dep(source = n10,target = n7)
e8 = E + Dep(source = n6,target = n11)

graph = Graph(name="bCMS_SR_Witness", nodes=N.all, edges=E.all)
```
